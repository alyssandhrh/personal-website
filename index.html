                    <p> Prior to beginning my college studies, I have experienceÂ worked for a cleaning agency. I started doing this job as a side job after obtaining my SPM. I have to serve the food court tenant with clean plates, cutlery, and glasses as part of my job. It greatly facilitates my ability to manage my responsibilities and my ability to interact with customers.</p>
                    <p> As an added bonus, I have experience managing outreach initiatives involving orphans from Rumah Anak Kesayangan in Penang. This programme has been really helpful to me in managing programmes that engage participants outside of the UiTM.It requires me to understand how to ask the administration for a budget, how to manage the budget for spending, and how to manage donations that have been successfully raised for the orphanage. In addition to that, I adored how orphans saw us as members of their own families.</p>
